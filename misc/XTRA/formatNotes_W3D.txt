Notes specific to W3D file format (shockwave 3D scene/model files):
this research is partly guided by the U3D specs due to the formats being related
There are some differences to be figured-out

Research has just begun, so it will be a while before too much useful information is generated

ints are all little-endian
strings are preceded by short length and are not null terminated

struct chunk {
	U32 ID
	U32 length
	Data(length)
	padding // keeps chunks 4-byte aligned
}

chunk 0x584649 { // read as string : "IFX" 00
	// header
	I32 unk1
	U32 filesize // of entire file
}

chunk 0xffffff21 {
	// texture
	string name
	U8 compressiontype // not yet comfirmed
	@compressiontype : 1 {
		JPEG image
	}
	@compressiontype : 3 {
		// further analysis required
		unknown bytes
		ZLIB stream
	}
}
